# XC-Hours

XC-Hours is a quick and dirty little script I wrote to help me stay on top of my IFR hours. As I'm writing this Readme, it occured to me that ForeFlight gives you an autofilled checklist for your requirements, but whatever. At least I had some fun.

### Usage

`python3 xc.py` then specify the path to you logbook CSV file relative to the script.


I'll probably add to it to include more IFR statistics based on FF logbook CSV files. Feel free to add to it :)
